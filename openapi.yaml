    # Basic concepts

    ## Versioning
    ### Definition
    Smarp supports a multi-version API, which means that multiple versions of our API could be available at the same time for API users.

    Versions are formated as  `v1`, `v2`, ... `vN`.

    #### Breaking changes
    Each new Major version contains at least one breaking change compared to the previous version,
    therefore no backward compatibility is guaranteed and adopting a new Major version will require developers’ adjustments to the breaking changes.

    ##### Breaking changes include:
    - Endpoints are removed or renamed
    - Parameters are removed, renamed or introduce a type change
    - New rules for request parameters are introduced. For example, when a parameter becomes mandatory
    - New rules for response parameters are introduced. For example, when a response parameter is omitted when empty, null or 0
    - Response codes are changed or removed

    #### Non-Breaking changes
    Non-breaking changes of API can be applied by Smarp at any time to existing versions.
    Please take this into consideration and refer to our latest documentation when implementing an application that uses Smarp’s API.

    ##### Non-breaking changes include:
    - New endpoints are added
    - New non-mandatory request parameters are added
    - New response parameters are added
    - Bug fixes

    #### Available versions
      List of avaialble versions:
      - [v1](  https://smarp.github.io/v1/)

    #### Example
    Accessing v1 endpoint
    ```
    https://smarp.smarpshare.com/api/v1/ping
    ```

    ## Authentication
    ### Create access token
    To get an access token, please check if you have `Channel manager`, `Group Admin` or `Company Admin` role (Check your current role by clicking your avatar on the top right-hand corner of the page. Your role is displayed under your name)

    - Access your company domain settings using the following URL `https://{subdomain}.smarpshare.com/#/profile/settings`
    - Navigate to `Access token` tab on the left-side menu.
    > If you are `Channel manager`, `Group Admin` or `Company Admin` role but cannot see Access token tab, please contact our support team to enable Access token feature.
    - If you don't have an access token, please create one by pressing `Create new access token` button. Then give the name for the token that is easier for you to remember.

    ### Using access token
    - If you already have an access token, press the button with copy icon (next to the token string).
    - To use an access token, you must put it to HTTP request header `Authorization`. Here is cURL example
    ```
    curl --request GET -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>" https://{subdomain}.smarpshare.com/api/{version}/allowed-access-token-api
    ```
    - Any API having `access-token` as `Authorizations` option in this documentation is potentially usable with access token, depending on whether you have the requiste user role permission.

    ## Requests and responses
    ### Pagination

    Some of the HTTP GET endpoints returns only portion of the requested data per request.

    Maximum amount of items returned per request is 1000.

    In order to iterate throughout other items use `next` parameter. The value of `next` could be obtained in the result of request.

    #### Example
    Accessing [GET posts](#tag/posts) v1 endpoint.

    First request
    ```
    https://smarp.smarpshare.com/api/v1/posts
    ```
    In the response there are 1000 items and link to the reference to the next request in `meta.next`

    ```
    {
      "meta": {
        "next": "510000000000000000000000"  <---- reference to the next request
      },
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "500000000000000000000000",
          "publishedAt": "2012-07-13T11:01:20Z",
          "title": "Post title N 1",
          "url": "https://someurl1",
          "type": "link"
        },
        ...
        {
          "id": "510000000000000000000000",
          "publishedAt": "2013-01-23T15:21:36Z",
          "title": "Post title N 1000",
          "url": "https://someurl1000",
          "type": "link"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    In order to get another batch of results send same `HTTP GET` request with `next` parameter.
    The value of `next` is taken from the results of the previous request.

    Second request

    ```
      https://smarp.smarpshare.com/api/v1/posts?next=510000000000000000000000
    ```

    In the response there is no `meta.next` value.

    It means that there is no more items to fetch, therefore there is no need to make any more calls.

       ```
       {
         "meta": {},
         "data": [
           {
             "id": "550000000000000000000000",
             "publishedAt": "2015-03-11T08:42:40Z",
             "title": "Post title N 1001",
             "url": "https://someurl1001",
             "type": "link"
           }
         ]
       }
       ```
    ## Anonymity
    Some of the endpoints contain User ID or equivalent field in their reponses.

    However, certain records in the responses may omit User ID or equivalent for users who are anonymous on Smarp.

    ### When a user is considered anonymous
    - A user has chosen to be anonymous in his/her personal settings
    - A user belongs to a Group that is set to protect its Users from being identified in analytics due to compliance reasons.

    ### Example
    ```json
      // UserId is in the response because the user is not anonymised
      {
        "UserId": "393c69300000000000000000",
        "PostId": "263c69300000000000000000"
      }

      // UserId is not in the response because the user is anonymised
      {
        "PostId": "493c69300000000000000000"
      }

    ```

    ## Limits and quotas

    ### Definition

    Smarp has the limits and quotas of requesting the APIs. These limits help Smarp provide a reliable and fast API to everyone. We put limits and quotas on API requests to protect the system from receiving more data than it can handle.

    **NOTE: _The limits and quotas are subject to change._**

    Each of the different types of rate limits has a specific duration. We start calculating the time after the first call, and at the end of that duration, we reset quotas.

    ### Current limits and quotas

    | Time period | Maximun request count | Quotas condition        |
    | ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
    | 10 minutes  | 100                   | per endpoint, per token |
    | 24 hours    | 1000                  | per token               |

    ### Example

    For example, if we have that two limits:
    100 requests per 10 minutes per endpoint per token and 1000 requests per 24 hours per token:

    1) We can send 100 requests to 10 different endpoints per day for a single token (100 request  * 10 endpoints = 1000 requests in total). If we do that in 1 hour, it means we should wait for 23 hours to reset quotas or use another token

    2) We can send 100 requests to 1 endpoint per 10 minutes. If we do that in 1 minute, it means we should wait for 9 minutes to reset quotas or use another token

    3) We can send 100 requests to 1 endpoint and 100 requests to the same endpoint per 10 minutes with a different token.
